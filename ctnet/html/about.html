      Our Mission
     </div>
     <div class="bottompadded">
      CAN is an <b>idea</b> with real potential to transcend money and politics. That's why CAN is more than just a company or a nonprofit or a political group. Indeed, it is none of those things.
     </div>
     <div class="bbordered right rpadded lpadded lmargined"><img src="/img/peacedome.jpg"></div>
     <div class="bottompadded">
      Based at the 'peace dome' in Copperopolis, California, CAN is funded and operated by attorney Greg Glaser to promote justice, liberty, and sustainable living. CAN is designed as an independent nonpartisan forum for wiki-style contributions. It's like a mini-democracy online for people who wish to share peaceful ideas and solutions.
     </div>
     <div class="bottompadded">
      CAN sets out to expose the real causes behind the crises we face, and empower individuals to choose sustainable solutions.
     </div>
     <div class="bottompadded">
      There are two primary functions of CAN: independent media and peaceful activism.
     </div>
     <div class="bbordered lfloat rmargined rpadded lpadded"><img src="/img/Strong_Fist.gif"></div>
     <div class="bottompadded">
      On the media side, CAN tracks news and research in order to offer an unbiased view into both mainstream and alternative viewpoints. Ideally, CAN would like to focus on the realities of our world, rather than propaganda and other distortions. We present evidence -- throughout history, many people, businesses, and nations have profited by harming others unfairly. Sovereign nations must try to do justice for all.
     </div>
     <div class="bottompadded">
      Advancing this focus is the peaceful activism side of CAN. We provide the leadership and online tools that empower individuals to accomplish civil action by exercising the right to petition the government through coordinated citizens' referenda.
